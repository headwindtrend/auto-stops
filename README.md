# auto-stops
**AutoStops** is a Sublime Text 3 plugin that automatically remembers "stops" ‚Äî   points where your cursor (or selection) stayed idle for a few seconds.   It‚Äôs like having automatic, time-aware bookmarks that you can quickly jump back to.

## Features

- ‚è± **Automatic stopmarks**  
  Records your selection after `idle_time` seconds of inactivity.

- üìå **Persistent memory**  
  Stops are saved with the view and restored when you reopen the file.

- üß≠ **Quick navigation**  
  Open a panel with all stops, preview by highlighting, and jump back instantly.

- üßπ **Cleanup controls**  
  Clear all stops in the current view with a single command.

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Customizable**  
  Configure idle timeout, maximum stored stops, and context size.

- **AutoStops: Show Stops**

  - Arrow keys (or Rightclick) to preview.
  - `Enter` (or Click) to jump or remove.
    - `OK` ‚Üí jump to the selected stop.  
    - `Exclude` ‚Üí remove the selected stop.
